# Journal: every event in the work, as a record a researcher can count

One entry per event: a contradiction found, a decision taken, a failure caught or missed, a change of
direction, a measurement. Not a restatement of the commit log (`git log` has what changed) and not
a status list (`DONE.md`, `TODO.md`) and not the design (`theGhost.md`): the journal records *what
happened while the work was done*. Fixed fields, so entries can be counted and compared across
projects (Katana keeps the same journal under its R-046, Suite Builder under G-162). Newest last.
Written by whoever was there, in the same commit as the event when possible; an agent writes its own
entries (E-008). `test/JournalTest.java` holds it: ids rise, every entry has its Who and its Class.

Field meanings. **Who**: Ghost, or the agent by its model name, or both. **Intent**: what the work
was trying to do when the event happened. **Found**: the fact the event turned on. **Options**: what
was considered, including the one taken. **Resolved**: what was done, by whom. **Touched**: decisions,
metrics, documents or modules the event changed or created. **Caught by**: for a failure, what
noticed it. **Cost**: wall time or commits, where known. **Class**: one of `contradiction`,
`ambiguity`, `failure-caught`, `failure-missed`, `decision`, `measurement`, `direction`, `trial`,
`deferred`.

### J-001 The project started, as the talent-matching idea with a name and a rubric
- **Who:** Ghost, with Fable. **Class:** decision.
- **Intent:** Start Employee Evaluator from the pitch.
- **Found:** The pitch was aimed at HR staff; the buyer is HR staff. The six metrics rewarded bloat as
  written; "actual quality against the same agent" needs a corpus that does not exist yet.
- **Options:** keep the pitch as written; aim it at the process. One composite score; seven ranked
  separately with ratios. A gate on provenance; a score.
- **Resolved:** Pitch aimed at the process (E-023); seven metrics, no composite, ratios (E-011);
  provenance a score with four layers, the fourth deferred (E-012). Website and GitHub app merged
  (E-002). Design doc written; repository created under Ghost in the Kernel Labs.
- **Touched:** docs/DESIGN.md; E-002, E-011, E-012, E-023.

### J-002 Java for the kernel, decided on what scales
- **Who:** Ghost, with Fable. **Class:** decision.
- **Intent:** Choose the scorer's language before any scaffold.
- **Found:** At 20k submitters the cost is model spend and the sandbox fleet, not orchestration; the
  Agent SDK has no Java.
- **Options:** TypeScript everywhere; Java kernel with a TypeScript frontend and a Python agent
  runner; Java with a TypeScript agent runner.
- **Resolved:** Java 21 kernel, TypeScript web, Python agent runner (E-001, E-003).
- **Touched:** E-001, E-003; docs/DESIGN.md.

### J-003 The parents' guardrails ported before the first line of product code
- **Who:** Ghost, with Fable. **Class:** direction.
- **Intent:** Ghost asked that every lesson from Katana and Suite Builder be in from the start:
  theGhost, intent maps, tests, readability rules, the kernel as the goal, modular design, AI
  navigability rules, the environment.
- **Found:** Katana's tooling (`scripts/`, the doc tests under `test/`) is plain Java with no
  dependency and ports with a rename; Suite Builder's module map and kernel map are the same idea
  Katana already carried. The one thing without a direct parent is the "intent map": Katana's Intent
  IR is facts with evidence, confidence and state, which is exactly what a score card should be.
- **Options:** write the guardrails fresh for a smaller project; port Katana's and prune later.
- **Resolved:** Ported: theGhost.md (E-001 to E-023), docs/modules.json and its test, the kernel map
  and its generator, the doc tests (ghost, docs, todo, glossary, journal, kernel map), AGENT.md with
  the metrics, the pinned image and offline build, CI with the network off. The score card became the
  intent map (docs/SCORE-CARD.md, E-017). Mutation testing and the tithe gate are proposed, not yet
  vendored (E-019, TODO.md 1.10).
- **Touched:** everything under docs/, scripts/, test/; theGhost.md; build.gradle; Dockerfile.

### J-004 CI made manual: the minutes are a scarce resource
- **Who:** Ghost, with Fable. **Class:** decision.
- **Intent:** The spotless pass over the scaffold before Opus starts 1.2.
- **Found:** The organization's GitHub Actions minutes are severely constrained, and GitHub is the
  only place apart from Ghost's PC where Windows builds work; a workflow on every push to `main`
  would spend them on what `scripts/prepush.sh` already proves locally.
- **Options:** keep the push trigger; run on a schedule; run by hand only.
- **Resolved:** By hand only (E-024). Also in this pass: `gradle metrics` aligned with the rows
  `docs/AGENT.md` tracks; the README got a Setup section; HANDOFF tells Opus that Gradle itself has
  not yet executed `build.gradle` (the workspace that wrote it had no Gradle and no Docker daemon)
  and to run the fast loop first.
- **Touched:** E-024; `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; `scripts/Metrics.java`; README.md; docs/HANDOFF.md.
